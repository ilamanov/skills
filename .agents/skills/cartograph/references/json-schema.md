# Cartograph JSON Schema (V0)

This is the contract between the extraction skill and the visualizer. Output must conform exactly to this structure.

## Top-level structure

```json
{
  "meta": { ... },
  "techStack": [ ... ],
  "surfaces": [ ... ],
  "features": [ ... ],
  "entities": [ ... ],
  "relationships": [ ... ],
  "operations": [ ... ],
  "flows": [ ... ],
  "compartments": [ ... ],
  "fileTree": [ ... ],
  "codeHealth": { ... },
  "invariants": { ... }
}
```

## `meta`

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "analyzedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "rootDir": "."
}
```

- `name` — repo/project name (from package.json or directory name)
- `analyzedAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `version` — schema version, always `"0.1.0"` for V0
- `rootDir` — root directory analyzed (usually `"."`)

## `techStack[]`

Detected technologies, frameworks, and libraries used by the project. Each entry represents a single technology with its category, version (when detectable), and source of detection. This key is **optional for backwards compatibility**; when absent, the visualizer should show a graceful "No tech stack data" state.

```json
{
  "id": "nextjs",
  "name": "Next.js",
  "version": "14.2.0",
  "category": "framework",
  "description": "React framework for server-rendered applications",
  "source": "package.json",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

- `id` — unique kebab-case identifier
- `name` — human-readable technology name (e.g., `"Next.js"`, `"Tailwind CSS"`, `"Prisma"`)
- `version` — detected version string, or `null` if version cannot be determined
- `category` — one of:
  - `"language"` — programming language (TypeScript, JavaScript)
  - `"framework"` — application framework (Next.js, React, Vue, Express, Fastify)
  - `"styling"` — CSS/styling solution (Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, styled-components, Sass)
  - `"database"` — database or ORM (Prisma, Drizzle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase)
  - `"auth"` — authentication provider (Clerk, NextAuth, Auth0, Firebase Auth)
  - `"api"` — API layer or protocol (tRPC, GraphQL, REST, gRPC)
  - `"testing"` — testing tools (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress)
  - `"deployment"` — hosting/deployment platform (Vercel, AWS, Docker, Cloudflare)
  - `"ai"` — AI/ML services or SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate, FAL)
  - `"payments"` — payment processing (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Paddle)
  - `"monitoring"` — observability/analytics (Sentry, PostHog, Datadog)
  - `"other"` — anything that doesn't fit the above categories
- `source` — where this technology was detected (e.g., `"package.json"`, `"tailwind.config.ts"`, `"prisma/schema.prisma"`)
- `confidence` — `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`

### Category ordering

When rendering, display categories in this order: language, framework, styling, database, auth, api, testing, deployment, ai, payments, monitoring, other.

### Detection guidance

- **High confidence**: explicit dependency in `package.json`, dedicated config file exists (e.g., `tailwind.config.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Medium confidence**: inferred from imports or code patterns but no config file (e.g., CSS Modules detected from `*.module.css` files)
- **Low confidence**: indirect evidence only (e.g., environment variable names suggesting a service)

## `codeHealth`

Persistent engineering health metrics. This key is **optional for backwards compatibility**; when absent, the visualizer should show a graceful "No code health data" state.

```json

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `analyzedAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp for when the health metrics were computed
- `metrics[]` — pluggable array of engineering metrics. The visualizer dispatches on `metric.id` to render each metric's finding type
  - `id` — stable kebab-case metric identifier (for example `"co-location"` or `"dryness"`)
  - `name` — human-readable label shown in the visualizer
  - `description` — 1 sentence explanation of what this metric measures
  - `score` — 0–100 integer or float
  - `thresholds.green` — score at or above this is green
  - `thresholds.yellow` — score at or above this is yellow and below green; anything lower is red
- `summary` — short plain-language summary of the current result
- `findings[]` — metric-specific finding objects
- `scalingFactor` — optional metric-specific scalar (currently used by DRYness)
- Metrics may define additional finding-level fields beyond the shared envelope. Dead-code findings use `target`, `evidence`, and `recommendation.detail`.

### Co-location metric

The co-location metric uses `metric.id = "co-location"` and binary pass/fail findings for every misplaced file.

```json
{
  "file": "lib/format-date.ts",
  "verdict": "fail",
  "reason": "Used exclusively by app/chat — should be co-located",
  "consumers": ["app/chat/[personaSlug]/components/message-bubble.tsx"],
  "recommendation": {
    "action": "move",
    "target": "app/chat/[personaSlug]/lib/format-date.ts"
  }
}
```

- `file` — misplaced file path
- `verdict` — `"pass"` or `"fail"`; only failing findings need to be emitted in the metric summary list
- `reason` — plain-language explanation of why the file is misplaced
- `consumers[]` — importing files that justify the verdict
- `recommendation.action` — `"move"` or `"promote"`
- `recommendation.target` — suggested new path or destination directory

### DRYness metric

The DRYness metric uses `metric.id = "dryness"` and emits duplication clusters or near-duplicate implementations.

```json
{
  "id": "prompt-remix-duplication",
  "title": "Prompt remix experience duplicated across surfaces",
  "severity": "high",
  "implementations": [
    {
      "location": "app/chat/[personaSlug]/components/prompt-remix.tsx",
      "description": "Chat-embedded prompt remix modal with conversation context"
    },
    {
      "location": "app/admin/components/remix-panel.tsx",
      "description": "Admin panel for remixing prompts during content review"
    }
  ],
  "sharedLogic": [
    "Prompt transformation state machine",
    "FAL API client for remix generation",
    "Prompt history tracking"
  ],
  "recommendation": {
    "action": "Extract shared logic",
    "target": "features/prompt-remix/",
    "shared": ["remix state machine", "API client", "prompt history hook"],
    "keepSeparate": ["admin UI chrome", "chat modal wrapper", "conversation context injection"]
  }
}
```

- `id` — stable finding identifier
- `title` — plain-language title of the duplication
- `severity` — `"high"`, `"medium"`, or `"low"`
- `implementations[]` — duplicated locations and what they do
  - `location` — file or directory path
  - `description` — why this implementation exists / what is special about it
- `sharedLogic[]` — specific duplicated logic worth extracting
- `recommendation.action` — consolidation strategy
- `recommendation.target` — suggested destination for shared logic
- `recommendation.shared[]` — logic that should be extracted
- `recommendation.keepSeparate[]` — logic that should remain implementation-specific

### Dead Code metric

The dead-code metric uses `metric.id = "dead-code"` and emits product-level and code-level dead-code findings. Test-only files are informational: they appear in `findings[]`, but they do **not** affect the dead-code score.

```json
{
  "id": "dead-file-lib-old-utils",
  "kind": "dead-file",
  "severity": "high",
  "target": "lib/old-utils.ts",
  "reason": "No file in the codebase imports this file",
  "evidence": {
    "importers": []
  },
  "recommendation": {
    "action": "remove",
    "detail": "Delete this file — nothing imports it and it is not an entry point."
  }
}
```

- `id` — stable finding identifier
- `kind` — `"dead-file"`, `"test-only-file"`, `"orphaned-surface"`, `"orphaned-feature"`, or `"dead-entity"`
- `severity` — `"high"`, `"medium"`, or `"low"`
- `target` — dead item identifier (file path, surface id, feature id, or entity id)
- `reason` — plain-language explanation of why the item was flagged
- `evidence` — kind-specific supporting evidence
- `recommendation.action` — `"remove"` or `"review"`
- `recommendation.detail` — concrete next step for an engineer

#### Dead-code evidence shapes

**`dead-file`:**

```json
{
  "importers": []
}
```

**`test-only-file`:**

```json
{
  "importers": ["__tests__/utils.test.ts", "__tests__/helpers.test.ts"]
}
```

**`orphaned-surface`:**

```json
{
  "route": "/settings/legacy",
  "navigationReferences": []
}
```

**`orphaned-feature`:**

```json
{
  "surfaceIds": ["legacy-settings"],
  "allSurfacesOrphaned": true,
  "implementationFiles": ["app/settings/legacy/components/feature-x.tsx"],
  "allImplementationsDead": true
}
```

**`dead-entity`:**

```json
{
  "entityKind": "db-model",
  "referencingOperations": [],
  "referencingFeatures": [],
  "prismaQueryCount": 0
}
```

## `invariants`

Product-level invariant verification results. Invariants are assertions about the codebase that should always be true — things like "credits are always refunded on failed generations" or "all production routes require authentication." They catch regressions in core product behavior that span multiple files and require understanding product intent.

This key is **optional for backwards compatibility**; when absent, the visualizer hides the Invariants tab entirely. Do **not** auto-initialize `invariants` to a default — treat its absence as "no invariant data."

Invariant definitions live in a separate file (`cartograph-invariants.md`) at the repo root — see `references/invariant-definitions-format.md` for the definition format. This key contains only the **verification results**.

```json
{
  "verifiedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "definitionsFile": "cartograph-invariants.md",
  "summary": {
    "total": 4,
    "passing": 3,
    "failing": 1,
    "skipped": 0
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "credits-refunded-on-failure",
      "name": "Credits refunded on failed generations",
      "severity": "critical",
      "status": "pass",
      "summary": "All 4 generation actions have refund paths on error",
      "tags": ["money", "credits"],
      "surfaceIds": ["chat-thread", "creation-studio"],
      "featureIds": ["image-generation"],
      "evidence": {
        "checkedFiles": [
          "app/chat/[personaSlug]/actions/generate-image.ts",
          "app/chat/[personaSlug]/actions/generate-video.ts",
          "app/create/actions/generate.ts",
          "app/create/actions/remix.ts"
        ],
        "violations": []
      },
      "verificationPrompt": "Read the file cartograph-invariants.md and verify the invariant 'credits-refunded-on-failure'. Check all server actions in app/chat/*/actions/ and app/create/actions/ that call AI generation APIs. Verify each has error handling that calls a credit refund function. Report pass/fail with evidence.",
      "fixPrompt": null
    }
  ]
}
```

- `verifiedAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp of when invariants were last verified
- `definitionsFile` — path to the invariant definitions file (relative to repo root)
- `summary` — aggregate counts
  - `total` — total number of invariant definitions found
  - `passing` — invariants with `status: "pass"`
  - `failing` — invariants with `status: "fail"`
  - `skipped` — invariants with `enabled: false`
- `results[]` — one entry per invariant

### Example: failing result

```json
{
  "id": "thumbnail-aspect-ratios",
  "name": "Thumbnail aspect ratios match media",
  "severity": "high",
  "status": "fail",
  "summary": "1 of 3 thumbnail generation paths produces incorrect aspect ratios",
  "tags": ["media", "ui"],
  "surfaceIds": [],
  "featureIds": ["media-upload", "thumbnail-generation"],
  "evidence": {
    "checkedFiles": [
      "app/media/components/thumbnail-generator.tsx",
      "app/upload/actions/process-media.ts",
      "lib/media/resize.ts"
    ],
    "violations": [
      {
        "file": "lib/media/resize.ts",
        "line": 45,
        "expected": "Thumbnail aspect ratio matches source media dimensions",
        "found": "Hardcoded 1:1 center crop for all thumbnails regardless of source aspect ratio",
        "suggestion": "Use source media dimensions to calculate thumbnail crop area"
      }
    ]
  },
  "verificationPrompt": "Verify the invariant 'thumbnail-aspect-ratios'. Check all thumbnail generation code in app/media/ and lib/media/. For each thumbnail generation path, verify that the output aspect ratio matches the source media's aspect ratio. Report pass/fail with evidence.",
  "fixPrompt": "Read the invariant 'thumbnail-aspect-ratios' in cartograph-invariants.md. The invariant is currently failing. Fix the violation in lib/media/resize.ts at line 45: the thumbnail generation uses a hardcoded 1:1 center crop for all thumbnails regardless of source aspect ratio. Update the resize logic to use source media dimensions to calculate the thumbnail crop area, preserving the original aspect ratio. After fixing, verify the invariant holds by checking all thumbnail generation paths."
}
```

### Example: skipped result

```json
{
  "id": "some-paused-invariant",
  "name": "Some paused invariant",
  "severity": "low",
  "status": "skipped",
  "summary": "Invariant is disabled (enabled: false)",
  "tags": [],
  "surfaceIds": [],
  "featureIds": [],
  "evidence": null,
  "verificationPrompt": null,
  "fixPrompt": null
}
```

## `surfaces[]`

A surface is a self-contained entry point or standalone piece of functionality in the app. Each app is a collection of surfaces — distinct experiences that work on their own (e.g., "Prompt Wizard", "Admin Review Dashboard", "Explore Feed"). Surfaces are the top-level organizational unit; entities are scoped to surfaces via `surfaceIds`.

```json
{
  "id": "prompt-wizard",
  "name": "Prompt Wizard",
  "description": "Interactive editing experience for creating and refining image generation prompts",
  "entrypoint": {
    "file": "app/create/page.tsx",
    "route": "/create"
  },
  "actor": "user",
  "entityIds": ["creation", "prompt-template", "model-config"],
  "operationIds": ["generate-preview", "refine-prompt"],
  "flowIds": ["creation-flow"],
  "compartmentIds": ["creation-studio-ui", "prompt-engine"],
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

- `id` — unique kebab-case identifier
- `name` — human-readable name for this surface
- `description` — 1-2 sentence explanation of what this surface does
- `entrypoint` — where this surface lives in code and routing
  - `file` — the main page/route file (relative path)
  - `route` — the URL route (e.g., `/create`, `/admin/reviews`)
- `actor` — primary actor: `"user"`, `"admin"`, or `"system"`
- `entityIds` — references to entity ids that this surface touches
- `operationIds` — references to operation ids used within this surface
- `flowIds` — references to flow ids that belong to this surface
- `compartmentIds` — references to compartment ids for code areas that serve this surface. Populated during Phase 9 (compartment dependency mapping)
- `confidence` — `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`

### Entity exposure

Every entity should appear in at least one surface's `entityIds`. Entities that appear in only one surface are **surface-scoped** (private to that experience). Entities that appear in many surfaces are **cross-cutting** (shared infrastructure). This exposure mapping is the key output — it shows how tightly coupled or independent each surface is.

## `features[]`

A feature is a standalone capability embedded within one or more surfaces. Surfaces are "where you go" (pages); features are "what you can do" (capabilities). Features are the reusable functional building blocks that surfaces compose — things like "the like system", "the prompt wizard", "the star credit system."

```json
{
  "id": "prompt-wizard",
  "name": "Prompt Wizard",
  "description": "Multi-step guided/custom interface for constructing image generation requests with AI-powered prompt suggestions",
  "kind": "tool",
  "surfaceIds": ["chat-thread"],
  "entityIds": ["creation", "message"],
  "implementations": [
    { "file": "app/chat/[personaSlug]/components/wizard-modal/index.tsx", "description": "Wizard modal entry point" },
    { "file": "app/chat/[personaSlug]/wizard-actions/core.ts", "description": "Server actions for wizard submission and FAL polling" }
  ],
  "compartmentIds": ["prompt-wizard-ui", "image-generation-pipeline"],
  "files": [],
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

- `id` — unique kebab-case identifier
- `name` — human-readable name
- `description` — 1-2 sentence explanation of what this feature does
- `kind` — one of:
  - `"tool"` — interactive multi-step experience (wizards, editors, sandboxes)
  - `"interaction"` — single-action engagement pattern (like, save, follow)
  - `"transaction"` — money/credit flow (purchase, tip, unlock)
  - `"gate"` — access control mechanism (age verification, NSFW filter, auth wall)
  - `"infrastructure"` — backend capability used by other features (AI generation, media processing)
  - `"workflow"` — multi-step admin/system process (review pipeline, scan workflow)
- `surfaceIds` — which surfaces embed this feature
- `entityIds` — which entities this feature reads/writes
- `implementations[]` — key files (2-5 most important)
  - `file` — relative file path
  - `description` — what this file does for the feature
- `compartmentIds` — references to compartment ids for code areas that implement this feature. This is the primary code-mapping mechanism — use compartments to understand which code belongs to this feature. Populated during Phase 9
- `files` — *(deprecated, kept for backwards compatibility)* exhaustive list of every file that participates in this feature. **No longer populated** — replaced by `compartmentIds`. Each entry:
  - `file` — relative file path
  - `role` — short label: `"component"`, `"action"`, `"hook"`, `"lib"`, `"style"`, `"test"`, `"type"`, `"config"`, `"api"`, `"other"`
- `confidence` — `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`

### Feature vs. Surface

A **surface** has a URL and is something users navigate to. A **feature** is a capability that could theoretically be extracted and reused elsewhere. If you can describe it without naming a specific page ("the like system", "the payment flow"), it's a feature. If it's inherently tied to a route ("the explore page"), it's a surface.

## `entities[]`

```json
{
  "id": "user",
  "name": "User",
  "kind": "db-model",
  "description": "A registered user of the application",
  "source": { "file": "prisma/schema.prisma", "line": 12 },
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "string", "description": "Unique identifier" },
    { "name": "email", "type": "string", "description": "User email address" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string?", "description": "Display name" }
  ],
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

- `id` — unique kebab-case identifier (used for cross-references)
- `name` — PascalCase display name
- `kind` — one of: `"db-model"`, `"dto"`, `"state"`, `"derived"`, `"config"`, `"enum"`
- `description` — 1-2 sentence plain-language explanation
- `source` — where defined in code. `file` is relative to rootDir
- `fields[]` — key properties. Include 3-8 most important fields, not every field
  - `name` — field name as in code
  - `type` — type as a readable string (e.g., `"string"`, `"number"`, `"Post[]"`, `"Date?"`)
  - `description` — what this field represents
- `confidence` — `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`
- `surfaceIds` — (derived, not stored in entity) computed by the visualizer from `surfaces[].entityIds`. Shows which surfaces reference this entity. Entities in 1 surface are "surface-scoped"; entities in 3+ surfaces are "cross-cutting".

## `relationships[]`

```json
{
  "id": "user-has-many-posts",
  "from": "user",
  "to": "post",
  "type": "has-many",
  "description": "A user can create multiple posts",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

- `id` — unique kebab-case identifier
- `from` — entity id (source)
- `to` — entity id (target)
- `type` — one of: `"has-many"`, `"belongs-to"`, `"has-one"`, `"references"`, `"derives-from"`
- `description` — plain-language explanation
- `confidence` — `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`

## `operations[]`

```json
{
  "id": "create-post",
  "name": "Create Post",
  "entityId": "post",
  "type": "create",

## `compartments[]`

A compartment is a logical grouping of related files that form a cohesive unit of functionality. Compartments bridge the product-side view (surfaces, features) with the underlying code structure. They are nestable (via `parentId`), non-exclusive (a file can appear in multiple compartments), and exhaustive (every non-generated file belongs to at least one compartment).

```json
{
  "id": "image-generation-pipeline",
  "name": "Image Generation Pipeline",
  "description": "Server actions, FAL client integration, and prompt assembly for generating images via the wizard and content studio.",
  "parentId": "content-generation",
  "tags": ["business-logic", "api-integration"],
  "files": [
    { "file": "app/chat/[personaSlug]/actions/generate-image.ts", "role": "action" },
    { "file": "lib/fal-client.ts", "role": "lib" },
    { "file": "lib/prompt-assembly.ts", "role": "lib" }
  ],
  "featureIds": ["image-generation", "prompt-wizard"],
  "surfaceIds": ["chat-thread", "admin-content-studio"],
  "dependsOn": ["media-delivery", "database-access"],
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

- `id` — unique kebab-case identifier
- `name` — human-readable compartment name (name after what it does, not folder names)
- `description` — 1-2 sentence explanation of what this code area does
- `parentId` — ID of parent compartment, or `null` for top-level compartments. Enables unlimited nesting depth
- `tags` — semi-structured tags from the suggested vocabulary below; the AI may also add custom tags as needed
- `files[]` — all files in this compartment with their roles
  - `file` — relative file path from repo root
  - `role` — one of: `"component"`, `"hook"`, `"action"`, `"api"`, `"lib"`, `"type"`, `"config"`, `"style"`, `"test"`, `"other"` (same role enum as feature files)
- `featureIds` — IDs of features this compartment implements (can be empty)
- `surfaceIds` — IDs of surfaces this compartment serves (can be empty)
- `dependsOn` — IDs of other compartments this one depends on (imports from). Only inter-compartment dependencies, no self-references
- `confidence` — `"high"` | `"medium"` | `"low"`

### Tag vocabulary (semi-structured)

Suggested core tags — the AI should use these when applicable and may create additional custom tags:

- `ui` — visual components, layouts, styling
- `data-access` — database queries, Prisma operations, data fetching
- `business-logic` — domain rules, calculations, validation
- `api` — API routes, server actions, external service integrations
- `api-integration` — third-party service clients (FAL, Clerk, Stripe, etc.)
- `infrastructure` — config, build tooling, dev tooling, CI/CD
- `shared` — utilities used across many compartments
- `state-management` — stores, context providers, state hooks
- `auth` — authentication and authorization
- `testing` — test files, test utilities, fixtures

### Compartment guidelines

- Don't create compartments with only 1 file — merge small groupings into their parent
- Keep top-level compartments to 8–15 for a typical web app; more sub-compartments are fine
- Prefer meaningful groupings over 1:1 folder mapping
- Every non-generated file must appear in at least one compartment
- Config/infra files go into a "Project Infrastructure" compartment

## `fileTree[]`

*(Experimental — fully isolated from existing data. See `specs/spec-file-tree.md` for the full spec.)*

A flat array of per-file entries with AI-estimated feature weight breakdowns. Used by the Feature Map visualizer tab to render feature-composition bars next to each file and folder in the tree.

```json
{
  "file": "app/chat/[personaSlug]/components/wizard-modal/index.tsx",
  "featureWeights": [
    { "featureId": "prompt-wizard", "weight": 0.7 },
    { "featureId": "image-generation", "weight": 0.3 }
  ]
}
```

- `file` — relative file path from repo root
- `featureWeights[]` — AI-estimated feature breakdown. All weights for a file must sum to 1.0
  - `featureId` — references a feature id from `features[]`, or the special value `"__infrastructure__"` for config/shared/unassigned files
  - `weight` — proportion (0.0–1.0)

### The `__infrastructure__` pseudo-feature

Files that don't belong to any product feature (config, build tooling, shared infra, generic type definitions) are assigned `"__infrastructure__"` with weight 1.0 (or partial weight if the file also serves a real feature). Rendered as neutral gray in the visualizer.

### Notes

- This key is **optional**. If missing, the Feature Map tab shows a "no data" message. All other tabs work normally.
- No existing keys are modified by this feature. Removing the `fileTree` key fully removes the feature.
- Feature weights are the AI's independent estimate — they don't need to be consistent with compartment-to-feature mappings.

## ID Convention

All IDs are kebab-case and globally unique within their array. Use descriptive names:
- Surface: `"explore-feed"`, `"admin-review"`, `"chat-thread"`
- Feature: `"prompt-wizard"`, `"star-credits"`, `"content-unlock"`, `"like-system"`
- Entity: `"user"`, `"blog-post"`, `"auth-session"`
- Relationship: `"user-has-many-posts"`, `"post-belongs-to-user"`
- Operation: `"create-post"`, `"delete-comment"`, `"publish-draft"`
- Flow: `"post-creation-flow"`, `"user-onboarding-flow"`
- Compartment: `"image-generation-pipeline"`, `"auth-system"`, `"project-infrastructure"`, `"ui-primitives"`

## Confidence Guidelines

- **high** — explicit definition found (Prisma model, typed interface, named route handler, server action)
- **medium** — inferred from usage patterns (e.g., a type used in API responses but not explicitly defined as an entity)
- **low** — best guess from limited evidence (e.g., an object shape seen once in a function parameter)
